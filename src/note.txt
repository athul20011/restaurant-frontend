basic
--------
  components(basic building blocks of react)
- react app starts with a single root component
- root component is built using one or more component
- each component can be nested with other component to any level



JSX :
  * jsx stands for javaScript Xml.
  * jsx provides you to write html/xml the processor will transform these expression into actual j.s code 
    eg- <div>Hello world</div>
       Corresponding o.p
         ---------------
       React.createElement(" ");
        Function :
          * Every JSX is converdet to the React.Element function call that the browser understands.
          * type - can be an HTMl tag like h1,div or it can be a REact components
          * props - are the attributes you want the element to have
          * children - contain the other 
          * React.createElement(type)   

        use of JSX :
          *    
        


  Virtual DOM 
  ------------
   -> it is like lightWeight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM)
   -> it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document
   -> vertual DOM gets updated first instead of real DOM.
   -> when anything new is added to the application, a vertual DOM is created and it is represented as a tree.
   -> whenever there is a change in the state of any element.a new virtual DOM tree is created.
    
    * the process of comparing the current virtual DOM tree with the previous one is known as 'Diffing'
    * the entire prosses of transforming changes to the real dom is called 'Reconcilation'      

  Anatomy of a React component :
 component rendering :
      > when a component function executes we sayit 'renders'
      > assume component may re-render at any time,our job is to ensure taht every time the compont re-render,the correct output is processed

  componts in react :

    * in react everithing is a component
    * 2 types 1,function-based(stateless) 2,class-based(statefull)   
  
  function-based component
  -----------------------
    * stateless component
    * we use hooks to change the component to statfull.

    Hooks :
    > Hooks were introduce in react 16.8.
    > it is use Reacts features-like managinh your components state and or performing an after effect when certine changes occurs in state without writing a class.

     state Hook :
      * the React useState Hooks allows us to track state in the function component.
      * state represent the value of a dynamic properties.
      * syndax : const [val,setVal] = useState(100);

        ->adding a state
          1. import {useState} from 'react';
          2. index = 0  , const [index,setIndex] = useState(0)
            then : updating the value of the state :
             function handleCLick(){
              setIndex += 1 ;
             }

 props :
      * props(properties) are compont
